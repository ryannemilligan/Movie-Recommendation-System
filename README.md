# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Systems

This project was developed for a Machine Learning Fundamentals course and demonstrates how to build two types of recommendation systems using real-world movie data.

## 📁 Datasets Used for Task 1 and Task 2
- [Movies & Ratings for Recommendation System (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicoletacilibiu/movies-and-ratings-for-recommendation-system)

- ## 📁 Datasets Used for Notebook
- (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data)

## 📌 Tasks (Bottom of Notebook)

### ✅ Task 1: Content-Based Filtering
- Uses movie genres to compute similarity between films
- Implements TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- Returns similar movies based on a selected title

### ✅ Task 2: Collaborative Filtering
- Builds a user-movie rating matrix
- Uses cosine similarity between users
- Recommends movies based on shared preferences

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity
- Google Colab environment

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
This project compares how content-based and collaborative filtering methods can be used to recommend movies, each with its own strengths and limitations.
